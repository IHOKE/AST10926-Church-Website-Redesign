<h1>AST10926 Church Website Redesign</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This repo is a complete <b>redesign and rebuild</b> of the <a href="https://github.com/IHOKE/AST10962-GPJ">previous repo</a> from scratch.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>After learning from the previous project, this project is rebuilt from the ground up,<br>
with much more focus on readability and ease of maintainance.<br>
This includes better formatting, indents, CSS variables,<br>
separating CSS files into common(used by index and all subpages) and specific CSS for each page.<br>
Making it much more easier to change anything (less likely to go insane).</p>
